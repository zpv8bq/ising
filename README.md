# ising

Multiple examples for Ising model and Metropolis algorithm

* onespin: model for a single spin flipping, see either onespin.cpp or Ising.ipynb
* two spin: two spins flipping, either twospin.cpp or Ising.ipynb
* ising1d: simulation of 1d lattice of spins, see ising1d.cpp or Ising.ipynb or ising1d.ipynb
* ising2d: simulation of 2d lattice of spins, see ising2d.cpp or ising2d.py
* ising2d_vs_T: Metropolis simulation of cooling a 1d lattice, see ising2d_vs_T.cpp or ising2d_vs_T.py
* ising1d_vs_T: Metropolis simulation of cooling a 1d lattice, see ising1d_vs_T.cpp

Complete the exercise for make plots of M,E,C in the 2d lattice using simulated annealing. <br>
